    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of data for various applications and systems, ranging from simple personal projects to complex enterprise-level applications.\n",
    "* SQL databases are based on the relational model, which means that they organize data into tables with rows and columns. These databases use SQL, a standardized language, to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. SQL databases have a predefined schema that defines the structure of the data, including data types, relationships, and constraints.\n",
    "* NoSQL databases, as the name suggests, do not follow the traditional relational model. Instead, they use various data models to store and retrieve data, such as key-value pairs, document-based (JSON or BSON), column-family, or graph-based structures. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and provide high scalability and flexibility."
